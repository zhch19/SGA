### Data Preparation

* **PASCAL_VOC 07+12**: Please refer [py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn#beyond-the-demo-installation-for-training-and-testing-models) for constucting PASCAL VOC Datasets.
* **WaterColor**: Please refer [Cross Domain Detection ](https://github.com/naoto0804/cross-domain-detection/tree/master/datasets). 
* **Nigti-time(Detrac-night)**: TBA.
* **CitysScape, FoggyCityscape**: Please refer [Cityscape](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/).

### All codes are written to fit for the format of PASCAL_VOC.
